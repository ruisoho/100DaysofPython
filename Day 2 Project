#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.💪

#Write your code below this line 👇

#Ask for how much is the bill
bill = input("How much is your bill?/n")

#Ask how many persons will split the bill
split = input("How many persons will split the bill?/n")

#Ask how much a percent you would like to tip
tip = input("How much percent would you like to tip? 10%, 15% or 20%?/n")
